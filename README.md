WP1: Quantification of the niche dynamics of alien plant species in the Pacific region

---------------------------------------------------------------

## Workflow

### 1 - Download species data

Occurrence data for 2788 alien plant species were downloaded from [BIEN](https://biendata.org/) and [GBIF](https://www.gbif.org/) in January 2023. The initial species selection is based on [Wohlwend et al., 2021](#5) and a list of noxious weeds on Hawaii. 


### 2 - Data preparation

### 3 - Assign invasion status

### 4 - Sampling background data and merging with environmental data

### 5 - Species selection 

### 6 - Niche comparison
