# NichePac - Niche Analysis 2023

**DFG Project:** NichePac <br/>
**Author:** Anna RÃ¶nnfeldt <br/>
**WP1:** Quantification of the niche dynamics of alien plant species in the Pacific region <br/>


## Workflow

### 1 - Download species data

Occurrence data for 2788 alien plant species were downloaded from [BIEN](https://biendata.org/) and [GBIF](https://www.gbif.org/) in January 2023. The initial species selection is based on [Wohlwend et al., 2021](#5) and a list of noxious weeds on Hawaii. 


### 2 - Data preparation

### 3 - Assign invasion status

### 4 - Sampling background data and merging with environmental data

### 5 - Species selection 

### 6 - Niche comparison




## Open issues

Status assignment: 
* getPowoNames does not work for Acoelorraphe wrightii
* script 03_status_assignment, line 103: manual selection of likely POWO entries is required for 346 entries. A list of these can be found under results/intermediate/powo_page_opts.RData

Workflow organisation:
* status assignment is still split over several scripts (for the testing phase)
